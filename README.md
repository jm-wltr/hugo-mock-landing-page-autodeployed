# hugo-mock-landing-page

A static landing page with custom formatting for an educational platform, **Connected Neurons**, built using Hugo for **CIS 3500**. This version is autodeployed with GitHub actions, so that every time I commit and push a change to the repository, the deployment is updated instantly.

## About Connected Neurons
Connected Neurons was a website I created during high school but unfortunately lost over time. This project is a small recreation of it, with a modern design and improved formatting (in my opinion).
